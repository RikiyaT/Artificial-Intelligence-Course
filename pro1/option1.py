# This code is using knn regression.In kNN regression, we look at k training data near the data and take 
# the average of those training data as the predicted value of ùë•0. The way regression is implemented in by 
# having the calculation of the distances is being done for every sample in X_test.
# For every sample in X_Train, the distances are calculated, and they are sorted in ascending order. Then, 
# k nearest neighbors are found and y_predict is returned. This is done for every sample in X_Test. This 
# is why Knn-regression works.
